**Overview**
This Python project aims to predict the prizes of laptops using machine learning techniques. The project utilizes various features of laptops such as specifications, brand, and market trends to make accurate predictions.

**Features**
Dataset: The project uses a dataset containing information about various laptops including their specifications (ScreenResolution, CPU, RAM, Memory), brands, and corresponding prizes.
Preprocessing: Data preprocessing techniques are applied to clean and prepare the dataset for machine learning models (extract information)
Modeling: Several machine learning models are explored and trained on the dataset to predict laptop prizes (RandomForestRegressor) 
Evaluation: The performance of each model is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to determine the accuracy of predictions.
Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is identified, it can be deployed for real-time predictions.

**Requirements**
Python 3.7
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for exploring the project interactively)
